# Credit Card Default Prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether a credit card holder will default on their payment in the upcoming month. Using a dataset of Taiwanese credit card clients, we apply a range of machine learning models — with a special emphasis on tree-based ensemble methods — to explore model performance, interpretability, and predictive power.
